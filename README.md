# quote-api
This is a backend challenge project from Codecademy using Express.js to make a simple CRUD API.  This is very beginner and basic.

## Installation
1) Ensure node is installed. You can check if you have it by using "node -v" to see what version you're on. If not, google node and install LTE version for your OS.
2) In the terminal, navigate to the parent directory and type "npm install", to install all dependencies.
3) To start server, type "node server.js". You should see a prompt saying listening on port 4001.
4) In the browser go to localhost:4001 in the URL.

### Features
There is only a predifined amount of hard coded quotes stored in a JS file. You can show all quotes, search by author (have to enter a name that matches fully to whats stored), click random quote, and create a new quote.
